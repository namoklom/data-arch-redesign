## üìå Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Enterprise Data Architecture (EDA)** redesign in the context of a company acquisition. It simulates the acquisition of **TrendyThreads**, a digital-native e-commerce company, by **FashionMart**, a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer. The goal is to create a unified, scalable, and modernized data architecture for the new combined entity, **FutureMart**.

## üéØ Objectives

- Assess the current state of data architecture in both FashionMart and TrendyThreads.
- Identify key strengths and areas for improvement in their respective architectures.
- Design a future-state EDA blueprint for FutureMart that supports integrated operations, analytics, and scalability.
- Implement RDBMS-to-NoSQL and NoSQL-to-RDBMS conversion strategies.
- Create scripts for ETL, data analytics, and database backup.
- Develop a data governance plan to ensure compliance, quality, and security of enterprise data.

Detailed PDF reports analyzing the maturity and limitations of each company‚Äôs data architecture, including suggestions for consolidation and enhancement.

### 3. FutureMart ER Diagram & Schema
A normalized relational schema and ER diagram representing the unified data model, suitable for operational and analytical workloads.

### 4. Data Model Conversion
Strategies and examples for converting between RDBMS and NoSQL models, ensuring flexibility and adaptability across technology stacks.

### 5. Shell Scripts
Executable scripts for common enterprise data tasks:
- ETL pipeline automation (`exercise_1_etl.sh`)
- Data analytics workflow (`exercise_2_data_analytics.sh`)
- MySQL database backup (`exercise_4_mysql_backup.sh`)

### 6. Data Governance Plan
A document outlining policies, roles, data lifecycle, security measures, compliance standards, and quality controls for FutureMart‚Äôs data assets.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **SQL (MySQL)**
- **NoSQL (MongoDB-like document models)**
- **Shell scripting (Bash)**
- **PDF and TXT documentation formats**

## üèÅ Outcome

This project demonstrates the application of **Enterprise Data Architecture** principles to solve real-world integration challenges faced during mergers and acquisitions. It ensures that **FutureMart** will operate on a cohesive, efficient, and scalable data infrastructure that supports both operational excellence and strategic decision-making.
