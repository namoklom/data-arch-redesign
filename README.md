## üìå Overview

This project presents a comprehensive **Enterprise Data Architecture (EDA)** redesign in the context of a company acquisition. It simulates the acquisition of **TrendyThreads**, a digital-native e-commerce company, by **FashionMart**, a traditional brick-and-mortar retailer. The goal is to create a unified, scalable, and modernized data architecture for the new combined entity, **FutureMart**.

## üéØ Objectives

- Assess the current state of data architecture in both FashionMart and TrendyThreads.
- Identify key strengths and areas for improvement in their respective architectures.
- Design a future-state EDA blueprint for FutureMart that supports integrated operations, analytics, and scalability.
- Define a unified relational schema and Entity Relationship (ER) diagram.
- Implement RDBMS-to-NoSQL and NoSQL-to-RDBMS conversion strategies.
- Create scripts for ETL, data analytics, and database backup.
- Develop a data governance plan to ensure compliance, quality, and security of enterprise data.

## üß© Key Components

### 1. EDA Blueprints
Visual representations of current and future data architecture components, highlighting data sources, processing layers, integration platforms, and analytical tools.

### 2. Strengths & Areas for Improvement
Detailed PDF reports analyzing the maturity and limitations of each company‚Äôs data architecture, including suggestions for consolidation and enhancement.

### 3. FutureMart ER Diagram & Schema
A normalized relational schema and ER diagram representing the unified data model, suitable for operational and analytical workloads.

### 4. Data Model Conversion
Strategies and examples for converting between RDBMS and NoSQL models, ensuring flexibility and adaptability across technology stacks.

### 5. Shell Scripts
Executable scripts for common enterprise data tasks:
- ETL pipeline automation (`exercise_1_etl.sh`)
- Data analytics workflow (`exercise_2_data_analytics.sh`)
- MySQL database backup (`exercise_4_mysql_backup.sh`)

### 6. Data Governance Plan
A document outlining policies, roles, data lifecycle, security measures, compliance standards, and quality controls for FutureMart‚Äôs data assets.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **SQL (MySQL)**
- **NoSQL (MongoDB-like document models)**
- **Shell scripting (Bash)**
- **ER modeling tools (e.g., Draw.io, Adobe Illustrator)**
- **PDF and TXT documentation formats**

## üèÅ Outcome

This project demonstrates the application of **Enterprise Data Architecture** principles to solve real-world integration challenges faced during mergers and acquisitions. It ensures that **FutureMart** will operate on a cohesive, efficient, and scalable data infrastructure that supports both operational excellence and strategic decision-making.
